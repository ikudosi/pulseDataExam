## Setup Instructions

This project was built and tested on node version 6.9.4.

#### Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Run the app:

```bash
npm run app
```

#### Open a browser and enter the following url:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

If you go into that url and it's loading, please wait for webpack to finish compiling it.

If for some reason this is not working, I included a compiled version of the app so simply run the following:

```bash
npm run api-server
```
